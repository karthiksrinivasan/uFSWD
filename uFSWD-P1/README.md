# uFSWD-P1
Udacity Full Stack Web Development - Project 1

The project provided the student with fresh_tomatoes.py file which helps in generating the nicely formatted HTML page. The students are requested to implement movie.py and entertainment_center.py to complete the project. The movie.py contains a class named Movie which includes movie title, movie poster image url and trailer url as it's data member. The entertainment_center.py does the data initialization by import Movie class from media.py and generates the html page by importing and calling open_movies_page() from fresh_tomatoes.py

To run the program:
``` sh
$ cd <project_dir> ; python entertainment_center.py
```
Or
``` sh
$ cd <project_dir> ; ./entertainment_center.py
```

You can open sample_page.html to see how the page looks like.
